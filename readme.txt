ASSIGNMENT: 9 - Scrabble

WRITEUP:
I really enjoyed this assignment, I completed all aspects of the written assignment including most of the extra credit (with the one exception being the extra credit dictionary validation part). The user is displayed a traditional scrabble board in size and layout along with a tray of 7 letters. If the user drags the letters onto the board it will display what word you currently are spelling along with what the score for that corresponding word is on the bottom. This score accurately reflects the effect that double/triple letter/word spaces have. When the desired word is found you click on the "Submit Current Word" button and it will add your score to the total score and clear the board/ give you 7 new letters. The "Refresh Your Letters" button also works by retrieving a random 7 letters from the bag after throwing your current ones back in. The porporitons of each letter are correct as well so the probablity of getting certain letters depends on which ones were already played. When an invalid word is played it will pop up with a dialog box explaining this.
